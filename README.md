# Intersection algorithm for two B-spline curves using BÃ©zier clipping

## Find intersection points between two B-spline curves

- Find intersection between one of (point, straight line, or curve) and one of (point, straight line, or curve).
- Each iteration info is saved in node_info.log file.
- Verbose info optionally can be saved in calc.log file.
- A curve should satisfy m = n + p + 1.
(m: knot vector [u_0, u_m], n: control points [P_0, P_n], p: degree of a curve)
- Overlapping can be found by adjusting a level of accuracy resulting in a lot of binary subdivisions.

## How to use

### Interpolation mode
- A curve is supposed to pass through the selected points.
- Global interpolation is used. A curve becomes distorted as the degree of a curve is elevated.
- The same point cannot be selected successively, which causes an LU decomposition failure.
- The minimum number of interpolation points to make a curve is degree + 2.

### Control points mode
- With the interpolation mode off, the selected points are control points of a curve.
- The minimum number of control points to make a curve is degree + 1.
- A point can be created by selecting the same point at least degree + 1 times.

## Limitation

- Not for self intersection
